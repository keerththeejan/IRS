Student Information System (SIS) is a web-based application software designed to introduce a conducive and structured information exchange environment for integrating students, parents, teachers and the administration of a college. Some > of the other software packages available for this purpose include Student Management System (SMS), Student Information Management System (SIMS) and Student Records System (SRS). These software systems enable educational institutions to supervise student-related activities such as keeping records of tests or examinations conducted, attendance, appraisal on performance including details of marks scored, particulars of everyday school attendance, and all other institution-related activities; in short, they provide a complete student records system. They are designed with diverse application potentials ranging from simple management of studentsâ€™ records at school to management of all student-related functions as well as administrative functions of a university or a chain of educational establishments.
